# üö© Common Flag Scoring System (CFSS)

## Description

The Common Flag Scoring System (CFSS) is a framework designed to give a score to a given flag from a Capture The Flag (CTF) challenge. The name is derived from the [Common Vulnerability Scoring System](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Common_Vulnerability_Scoring_System) (CVSS), widely used in the computer security industry to score software vulnerabilities.

## Goal

The goal of CFSS is to reduce subjectivity from challenge designers when determining the score a flag should have by providing clear guidelines and criteria. The CFSS score can also be shared with participants to justify how the scoring of the flag was determined, which increases transparency and reinforce competitive integrity of CTF competitions.

## Guiding Principles

CFSS was created in respect with these principles. They are in order, from most important to least important:

1. **Competitive Integrity.** This refers to the fact that skill should be the single most deciding factor in who wins and who loses a CTF and their position in the scoreboard. This is done by limiting factors based on luck or other unpredictable events.
2. **Accuracy**. Accuracy refers to how close a measurement (here, the score) is close to the truth. In this context, accuracy means that scores calculated using CFSS in a given CTF, when ordered ascendingly, presents the challenges sorted by the skill and effort required to solve them.
3. **Precision**. Precision refers to how close many measurements (here, the score) are close to each others. Precision is independant of accuracy. In this context, precision means that if five different people calculate the CFSS for a given flag, they would all have the same score.
4. **Maximizing Fun**. This mostly refers to the ‚Äúgamified‚Äù aspect of CTFs, including minimizing unfun experiences, such as losing points.

When questions arise where the answer is not obvious, one must refer to these guiding principles, in order, to determine how to correctly apply CFSS.

## What CFSS is NOT for

- CFSS does not score for the quality of a challenge. One might have trouble applying CFSS to challenges with questionable design, such as challenges involving guessing (because guessing does not translate well to technical skill nor effort).
- CFSS does not determine which categories are ‚Äúhigh skill floor‚Äù. This must be decided in the context of the CTF in which CFSS is used in. For example, a CTF targeted at software developers will most likely not consider categories involving a lot of scripting or programming as a high skill floor category, but a CTF targeted at Sysadmins or people with little to no programming experience might.

## CFSS Specification

The scoring system algorithm takes as input:
- Technical Skillset ( `L`/`B`/`I`/`A` )
- Effort ( `L`/`M`/`H`)
- High Skill Floor Category ( `Y`/`N` )
And **outputs a score range from <u>1 to 20</u>**. ****The higher the score, the more difficult the flag is to obtain and thus the more skill and effort is required to find it.

To calculate the score, sum all of the inputs‚Äô minimum weight and their maximum weight separately, and the score range is those two values.

### CFSS expression

A CFSS score can be expressed like this:

`CFSS:<cfss_version>/TS:<technical skillset value shorthand>/E:<effort value shorthand>/HSFC:<high skill floor category shorthand>=<flag point range>` 

Example: **CFSS:0.2/TS:L/E:L/HSFC:N=1-2**

## Special cases

### How to apply CFSS in a (semi-)linear track featuring multiple flags

CFSS is applied for each flag individually. To apply CFSS to a flag which is part of a bigger track (featuring multiple flags), consider that the participant has found all strictly-required flags with the intended solution, and assume that they possess all the knowledge from the previous strictly-required flags. Then, you can apply the three criteria (technical skill, effort and high skill floor) to this flag normally.

See [Fifth flag of a track featuring 8 flags total](#fifth-flag-of-a-track-featuring-8-flags-total) for an example.

## Examples

### Rule Flag

**CFSS:0.2/TS:L/E:L/HSFC:N=1-2**

**Technical Skillset (TS)**: Little to None (L)

**Effort (E)**: Low (L)

**High Skill Floor Category (HSFC)**: No (N)

**Score range**:
Minimum: (1 + 0 + 0) = 1
Maximum: (1 + 1 + 0) = 2
The score range is 1-2 (1 or 2)

### Flag from Exploiting a basic PHP File Upload Vulnerability

In this example, the vulnerability to exploit is pretty explicit and requires uploading a PHP file with custom code and then accessing the uploaded file, where the path is known.

**CFSS:0.2/TS:B/E:L/HSFC:N=2-4**

**Technical Skillset (TS)**: Beginner (B)

**Effort (E)**: Low (L)

**High Skill Floor Category (HSFC)**: No (N)

**Score range**:
Minimum: (2 + 0 + 0) = 2
Maximum: (3 + 1 + 0) = 4
The score range is 2-4 (2 or 3 or 4)

### Flag from Reverse Engineering a Rust Binary Without Debugging Symbols with Custom Obfuscation and Strong Anti-Debugging

**CFSS:0.2/TS:A/E:H/HSFC:Y=13-20**

**Technical Skillset (TS)**: Advanced (A)

**Effort (E)**: High (H)

**High Skill Floor Category (HSFC)**: Yes (Y)

**Score range**:
Minimum: (7 + 5 + 1) = 13
Maximum: (10 + 8 + 2) = 20
The score range is 13-20 (13 or 14 or 15 or 16 or 17 or 18 or 19 or 20)

### Flag from a Forensics Challenge to parse an Undocumented Windows Artifact

In this example, it is explicit what you need to do, but how to do it is not clear and requires research and skills to understand what to research.

**CFSS:0.2/TS:A/E:M/HSFC:N=13-20**

**Technical Skillset (TS)**: Advanced (A)

**Effort (E)**: Medium (M)

**High Skill Floor Category (HSFC)**: No (N)

**Score range**:
Minimum: (7 + 2 + 0) = 9
Maximum: (10 + 4 + 0) = 14
The score range is 9-14 (9 or 10 or 11 or 12 or 13 or 14)

### Password Cracking Challenge Where you Need to Build your Own Custom Wordlist

In this example, it is explicit what you need to do, but building your wordlist requires scripting a custom web scraping tool and trying many hypothesis on what passwords have been used and how they have been generated.

**CFSS:0.2/TS:I/E:H/HSFC:N=13-20**

**Technical Skillset (TS)**: Intermediate (I)

**Effort (E)**: High (H)

**High Skill Floor Category (HSFC)**: No (N)

**Score range**:
Minimum: (4 + 5 + 0) = 9
Maximum: (6 + 8 + 0) = 14
The score range is 9-14 (9 or 10 or 11 or 12 or 13 or 14)

### Fifth flag of a track featuring 8 flags total

Consider the following track where the intended solving path is this:

```
Here, 
Flag X --> Flag Y
           Flag Z
Means "Flag X is required to find Flag Y and Flag Z"
--------------------
Flag 1 --> Flag 3 --> Flag 4 --> Flag 6 --> Flag 8
           Flag 2     Flag 5 --> Flag 7
```

To apply CFSS to `Flag 5`, we need to assume that the participant has found `Flag 1` and `Flag 3` (because they are required to solve `Flag 5`), but NOT `Flag 2` nor `Flag 4`( because they are NOT required to solve `Flag 5`). 

**The technical skill, effort and high skill floor criteria need to be decided assuming that the participant has all the information from the beginning of the challenge, plus the information to solve `Flag 1`, plus the information to solve `Flag 3`.**
